# Unofficial ANT SDK

This is an altered version of the last released version of the ANT SDK from Dynastream Innovations, rearranged to compile the "ANT_DLL" to a shared library on both Linux and MacOS.

On Linux it requires that libusb be installed, and uses the IOKit framework on OS X.

It's a work in progress, distributed under the terms of the ANT+ Shared Source License. See License.md for details.
